You and me
We used to be together, everyday together
Always, I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though you're lettin' go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts


Our memories
Well, they can be invitin'
But some are altogether mighty frightenin'
As we die both you and I
With my head in my hands, I sit and cry
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak

The review of the song: very nice and melodic one!
